Project Overview: Recipe Sharing Platform

Description: Create a Recipe Sharing Platform where users can register, log in, create,
view, edit, and delete their own recipes. Users can browse recipes posted by others,
categorize them, leave comments, and search for recipes based on ingredients or categories.
This project will help you understand the core components of Django, including models, views,
templates, and URL routing, while providing a hands-on experience with user authentication,
CRUD operations, and dynamic content rendering. Functionalities

User Authentication:
    Registration: Users can create an account with a username, email, and password.
    Login/Logout: Users can log in to access personalized features and log out securely.
    Profile Management: Users can view and edit their profile information.

Recipe Management:
    Create Recipe: Authenticated users can add new recipes with details like title,
    ingredients, instructions, category, and an optional image.
    View Recipes: All users can browse and view recipes. Implement pagination for better user experience.
    Edit/Delete Recipe: Users can edit or delete only the recipes they have created.
    Recipe Detail Page: Detailed view of each recipe, including comments and author information.

Categorization & Search:
    Categories: Recipes can be categorized (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert). Users can filter recipes by category.
    Search Functionality: Users can search for recipes by title or ingredients.

Comments:
    Add Comments: Authenticated users can leave comments on any recipe.
    View Comments: Display a list of comments on the recipe detail page.

Responsive Design:
    Ensure the platform is responsive and user-friendly on various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
